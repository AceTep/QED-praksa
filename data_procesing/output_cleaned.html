<br/>of a mild inability to stand up.

<br/>Ken Walsh, a very battered copy that I had borrowed from someone. In fact,
<br/>since this was 1971 and I still have the book, it must count as stolen by

<br/>directions from a man in the street. I knew this mightn’t be easy because I
<br/>don’t speak German, but I was surprised to discover just how much
<br/>difficulty I was having communicating with this particular man. Gradually
<br/></span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px">the truth dawned on me as we struggled in vain to understand each other

<br/>dumb. With a series of sincerely apologetic hand movements, I disentangled
<br/>myself, and a few minutes later, on another street, I stopped and asked
<br/>another man who also turned out to be deaf and dumb, which was when I
<br/>bought the beers.

<br/>When the third man I spoke to turned out to be deaf and dumb and also
<br/>blind I began to feel a terrible weight settling on my shoulders; wherever I
<br/>looked the trees and buildings took on dark and menacing aspects. I pulled
<br/>my coat tightly around me and hurried lurching down the street, whipped by
<br/>a sudden gusting wind. I bumped into someone and stammered an apology,
<br/>but he was deaf and dumb and unable to understand me. The sky loured.
<br/></span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px">The pavement seemed to tip and spin. If I hadn’t happened then to duck
<br/>down a side street and pass a hotel where a convention for the deaf and
<br/>dumb was being held, there is every chance that my mind would have
<br/>cracked completely and I would have spent the rest of my life writing the
<br/>sort of books which Kafka became famous for and dribbling.

<br/>Later I became a writer and worked on a lot of things that were almost
<br/>incredibly successful but in fact just failed to see the light of day. Other

<br/>science fiction, and it was this obsession that drove me into deep debt and
<br/>despair. No one was interested, except finally one man: a BBC radio
<br/>producer named Simon Brett who had the same idea, comedy and science
<br/>fiction. Although Simon only produced the first episode before leaving the
<br/>BBC to concentrate on his own writing (he is the author of the Charles Paris
<br/>detective novels), I owe him an immense debt of gratitude for simply
<br/>getting the thing to happen in the first place. He was succeeded by the

<br/>feeling a little disgruntled with the world at the time and had put together
<br/>about six different plots, each of which ended with the destruction of the
<br/>world in a different way, and for a different reason. It was to be called ‘The
<br/>Ends of the Earth’.
<br/></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:91px; top:5261px; width:439px; height:14px;"><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px">While I was filling in the details of the first plot – in which the Earth was

<br/>that I needed to have someone from a different planet around to tell the
<br/>reader what was going on, to give the story the context it needed. So I had
<br/>to work out who he was and what he was doing on the Earth. I decided to
<br/>call him Ford Prefect. (This was a joke that missed American audiences
<br/>entirely of course, since they had never heard of the rather oddly named car,
<br/></span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px">and many thought it was a typing error for Perfect.) I explained in the text
<br/>that the minimal research my alien character had done before arriving on
<br/>this planet had led him to think that this name would be ‘nicely
<br/>inconspicuous’. He had simply mistaken the dominant life form. So how
<br/>would such a mistake arise? I remembered when I used to hitchhike through
<br/>Europe and would often find the information or advice that came my way
<br/>was out of date or misleading in some way. Most of it, of course, just came
<br/>from stories of other people’s travel experiences.

<br/>decided, would be a researcher who collected data for the </span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif-Italic; font-size:14px">Guide</span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px">. As soon as
<br/>I started to develop this particular notion, it moved inexorably to the centre
<br/>of the story, and the rest, as the creator of the original Ford Prefect would
<br/>say, is bunk.
<br/></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:76px; top:5624px; width:447px; height:83px;"><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px">The story grew in the most convoluted way, as many people will be
<br/>surprised to learn. Writing episodically meant that when I finished one
<br/>episode I had no idea about what the next one would contain. When, in the
<br/>twists and turns of the plot, some event suddenly seemed to illuminate
<br/>things that had gone before, I was as surprised as anyone else.

<br/>people – initial doubts, followed by cautious enthusiasm and then greater
<br/>and greater alarm at the sheer scale of the undertaking and still no end in

If the show hadn’t worked . . .
<br/>The first episode went out on BBC Radio 4 at 10.30 p.m. on Wednesday,
<br/>8 March 1978, in a huge blaze of no publicity at all. Bats heard it. The odd
<br/>dog barked. After a couple of weeks a letter or two trickled in. So –
<br/>someone out there had listened. People I talked to seemed to like Marvin
<br/>the Paranoid Android, whom I had written in as a one-scene joke and had
<br/>only developed further at Geoffrey’s insistence. Then some publishers
<br/>became interested, and I was commissioned by Pan Books to write up the
<br/></span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px">series in book form. After a lot of procrastination and hiding and inventing
<br/>excuses and having baths, I managed to get about two-thirds of it done. At
<br/>this point they said, very pleasantly and politely, that I had already passed
<br/>ten deadlines, so would I please just finish the page I was on and let them
<br/>have the damn thing.

<br/>your own radio series, especially one that somebody had written in to say
<br/>they had heard, it didn’t exactly buy you lunch.

<br/>Guide to the Galaxy</span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px"> was published in September 1979 and appeared on the
<br/></span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif-Italic; font-size:14px">Sunday Times</span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px"> bestseller list at number one and just stayed there. Clearly,

The </span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif-Italic; font-size:14px">Guide</span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px"> has appeared in so
<br/>many forms – books, radio, a television series, records and soon to be a

<br/>programmes, or ‘fits’ as they were called. Fits 1 to 6. Easy. Later that year,
<br/>one more episode was recorded and broadcast, commonly known as the
<br/></span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px">Christmas episode. It contained no reference of any kind to Christmas. It
<br/>was called the Christmas episode because it was first broadcast on 24

It was a substantially expanded
<br/>version of the first four episodes of the radio series, in which some of the
<br/>characters behaved in entirely different ways and others behaved in exactly
<br/>the same ways but for entirely different reasons, which amounts to the same
<br/>thing but saves rewriting the dialogue.

<br/>was, by contrast, a slightly contracted version of the first four episodes of
<br/>the radio series.

<br/></span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px">new recordings of substantially the same scripts. This was done because we
<br/>had used music off gramophone records as incidental music for the series,
<br/>which is fine on radio, but makes commercial release impossible.
<br/></span></div><div style="position:absolute; border: textbox 1px solid; writing-mode:lr-tb; left:76px; top:7118px; width:454px; height:204px;"><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px">In January 1980, five new episodes of </span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif-Italic; font-size:14px">The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the
<br/>Galaxy</span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px"> were broadcast all in one week, bringing the total number to twelve
<br/>episodes. In the autumn of 1980, the second </span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif-Italic; font-size:14px">Hitch Hiker</span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px"> book was
<br/>published in Britain around the same time that Harmony Books published
<br/>the first book in the United States. It was a very substantially reworked, re-
<br/>edited and contracted version of episodes 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 5 and 6 (in that
<br/>order) of the radio series </span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif-Italic; font-size:14px">The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy</span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px">. In case
<br/>that seemed too straightforward, the book was called </span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif-Italic; font-size:14px">The Restaurant at the
<br/>End of the Universe</span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px">, because it included the material from radio episode 5
<br/>of </span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif-Italic; font-size:14px">The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the Galaxy,</span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px"> which was in a restaurant called
<br/>Milliways, otherwise known as the Restaurant at the End of the Universe.

This
<br/>was based, more or less, on the first six episodes of the radio series. In other
<br/>words, it incorporated most of the book </span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif-Italic; font-size:14px">The Hitch Hiker’s Guide to the
<br/>Galaxy</span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif; font-size:14px"> and the second half of the book </span><span style="font-family: LiberationSerif-Italic; font-size:14px">The Restaurant at the End of the

<br/>series, it incorporated revisions from the books, which didn’t.

<br/>difficult to say what it was. Perhaps it was that his eyes didn’t seem to blink
<br/>often enough and when you talked to him for any length of time your eyes
<br/>began involuntarily to water on his behalf. Perhaps it was that he smiled
<br/>slightly too broadly and gave people the unnerving impression that he was
<br/>about to go for their neck.

<br/>‘Promise,’ said Ford. He turned to Arthur.
<br/>‘Come on,’ he said to him, ‘get up and let the man lie down.’
<br/>Arthur stood up, feeling as if he was in a dream.
<br/>Ford beckoned to Prosser who sadly, awkwardly, sat down in the mud.
